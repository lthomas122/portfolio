It was the world's first wafer-on-wafer AI processor and maybe even the world's first <em>actual</em> wafer-on-wafer processor. Wafer-on-wafer, by the way, means two silicon wafers stacked on top of each other, unlike the usual single wafer in most chips found in almost all technology products. Why? <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moore's Law</a> is coming to an end, and while the amount of transistors we can fit onto a single die may be reaching its limits horizontally, some clever people at <a href=\"https://3dfabric.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/3DFabric.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TSMC</a> have come up with an innovate 3D stacking technology that allows chip designers almost limitless transistor scaling, but in a vertical fashion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-task\"><a href=\"#the-task\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Task</h3>\n<p>As Head of Creative, my task was to design, direct and create all of the assets needed to market the products across multiple channels, as well as head up the required web development, whilst also curating the visual identity of the launch. There were some interesting challenges in this project and I learnt so much. It may even be my proudest project to date, it's certainly one of the biggest projects I've ever worked on. </p>\n<h3 id=\"taking-it-to-the-next-dimension\"><a href=\"#taking-it-to-the-next-dimension\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Taking it to the Next Dimension</h3>\n<p>One of the first things I decided to do with this project was to \"tweak\" our branding. Why exactly? Firstly, we needed to make an impact with this launch and sometimes moving away from <em>the norm</em> can turn heads. Graphcore's branding is traditionally very flat and minimal. We use a lot of decorative 2D shapes in our designs and in the animations on the <a href=\"graphcore.ai\">website</a>. Since this product utilised 3D technology, I thought why not make all the assets in 3D instead of 2D?</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-chip-diagram\"><a href=\"#the-chip-diagram\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Chip Diagram</h3>\n<p>Coincidentally, it ended up being very handy when it came to creating chip diagrams (to detail the architecture/design of the chip), because it was nearly impossible to design a clear and effective 2D diagram of a 3D architecture. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*JCxqJkKsJvJuWfB2X7oy2Q.gif\" alt=\"Interactive 3D Chip Diagram\" />\n<figcaption><em>You can find this interactive diagram in the wild <a href=\"https://www.graphcore.ai/bow-processors\">here</a></em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"product-photography\"><a href=\"#product-photography\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Product Photography</h3>\n<p>Previous photography for Graphcore products emulated the flat 2D branding. Products would be shot face on (or at least as flat as possible) with a single colour background using one of the brand's \"ice cream\" colours. All shadows would be removed in post production.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*kvMfux-oDXpgew0eT2WHfA.jpeg\" alt=\"Old vs New Photography\" />\n<figcaption><em>Old style product image (left) vs. New style image (right)</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For this launch, we needed to break the mold. I directed our photographer to indulge in the shadows, \"No more flatness, we want depth\". Any photos or renders needed to convey a rich, three-dimensional landscape. </p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*JmLZjVm6VSitDcplSwjlIw.jpeg\" alt=\"Indulge in the shadows\" />\n<figcaption><em>New IPU Pod render in 3D style</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"the-launch-video--animation\"><a href=\"#the-launch-video--animation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Launch Video + Animation</h3>\n<p>The following is some of the most striking, but challenging work I have ever done. The finished pieces are some of my proudest work to date. For the launch video and its animation, we hired the help of some freelancers that we work with regularly. We had tight deadline of three months (and I had to fight tooth-and-nail for sign-off) to produce a 3D animation and a launch video, containing footage of executives and engineers explaining the intricacies of the product. </p>\n<figure>\n<iframe class=\"vidyard_iframe\" title=\"Bow - the next IPU\" src=\"//play.vidyard.com/GKo8CojfLyZZq1pQirifva.html?\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"></iframe>\n<figcaption><em>The Bow launch animation video</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I was responsible for the creative direction and music supervision of the video. Regularly liaising with the 3D motion artists at each step of the way, while also trying to find the perfect music to fit the theme I wanted to convey. </p>\n<p>The long-form video with interviews from the CEO, CTO and engineers can be found <a href=\"https://share.vidyard.com/watch/oXrpVY7bMh1uXSffbv3gL9?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-product-pages\"><a href=\"#the-product-pages\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Product Pages</h3>\n<p>Graphcore's tired, old product page layouts needed a redesign for the new generation of Bow products. I decided to tap into some e-commerce knowledge I had picked up at my time at Nisbets (I used to work in their e-commerce department), and adopt a Z-layout for the product pages. This layout will be very familiar to anyone who shops online regularly. At the same time, I saw an opportunity to improve the UI/UX/CX and decided to include a tab system that could not only highlight marketing and performance materials, but also useful aftersales materials like product specs and product documentation (e.g. installation guides).</p>\n<figure>\n<video autoplay width=\"640\" muted loop disablepictureinpicture playsinline>  \n  <source src=\"/assets/media/productpagebow.webm\" type=\"video/webm\"> \n  <source src=\"/assets/media/Product Page bow.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"> \n  Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.  \n</video>\n<figcaption><em>The POD256 product page.
